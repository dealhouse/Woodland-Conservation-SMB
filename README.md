This version of the project was migrated from CRA to Vite to be more in line with the course material for this semester.  

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Cloning the Repository
Once added as a collaborator:

**Using SSH (recommended):**
    git clone git@github.com:dealhouse/Woodland-Conservation-SMB.git

**Using HTTPS:**
    git clone https://github.com/dealhouse/Woodland-Conservation-SMB.git

**Navigate to the project folder:**
    cd Woodland-Conservation-SMB

### Setup and Run
    # 1) Install dependencies
    npm install

## ðŸ§  Setup Notes
- The `.gitignore` file already excludes `node_modules`, build files, and `.env`, so your API keys and dependencies wonâ€™t be uploaded to GitHub.  
- If you create other sensitive files (like `.env.development` or `.env.production`), make sure theyâ€™re listed in `.gitignore` as well.
