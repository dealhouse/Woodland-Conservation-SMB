1. Conservation Burial Grounds - Highest standard, land is protected forever.
2. Natural Burial Grounds - Managed woodland/meadow habitats.
3. Hybrid Cemeteries - Conventional cemeteries with natural burial sections.

II. Alternative Eco-Friendly Methods
1. Natural Organic Reduction (Human Composting)
2. Alkaline Hydrolysis (Water Cremation)
3. Tree Pod Burial (Concept concept)`

Upright Headstones are common in conventional cemeteries but are generally avoided in natural settings. Flat Markers (plaques set flush with the ground) are often used in hybrid cemeteries for simple identification. In strict natural burial grounds, the preferred markers are a Natural Stone/Fieldstone or a Living Marker, such as a native tree or shrub, ensuring the memorial blends into and supports the natural landscape.'
